# Introduction
Private room where only you have access; no one else is allowed in, can be a sacred space

> Deep Work: Professional activities perfromed in a state of distraction-free concentartion that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

> Deep work, of course, is not limited to the historical or technophobic. Bill Gates famously conducted "Think Weeks" twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.

> Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perfrom deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a conesquence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

> three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

# Part 1 - The Idea
## Chapter 1 - Deep Work is Valuable
Who will survive in the modern economy?
### The High-Skilled Workers
People who are good at working with the intelligent machines; those who can work with and tease valuable results out of complex machines.
### The Superstars
Once the talent market is made universally accessible, the best will thrive and the rest will fall. It becomes a winner take all market.
### The Owners
Those with the capital to invest in the Great Restructuring.

### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy
The two core abilities for thriving in the new economy are:
1. The ability to quickly master hard things;
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.

### Deep Work Helps you Quickly Learn Hard Things

### Deep Work Helps you Produce at an Elite Level

### What About Jack Dorsey
Interesting aside here about CEOs, their jobs are inherently to work "shallow", to take in many inputs and make decisions quickly. This is what I'm building towards, and will be my role eventually, but until then, focus on the deep work of building the company itself.

> A good chief executive is essentially a hard-to-automate decision engine, not unlike IBM's Jeopaardy!-playing Watson system. They have built up a hard-won repository of experience and have honed and proved an instinct for their market. They're then presented inputs throughout the day--in the form of emails, meetings, site visits, and the like -- that they must process and act on. To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It's better to hire three smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring their solutions to the executive for a final decision.

## Chapter 2 - Deep Work is Rare

### The Metric Black Hole

### The Principle of Least Resistance

> The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity

> Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

### The Cult of the Internet

### Bad for Business. Good for You.

## Chapter 3 - Deep work is Meaningful

### A Neurological Argument for Depth

> Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavior economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and they key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience. 

> The implication of these findings is clear. In work, to increase the time yous pend in a state of edpth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in away that for several different neurological reasons maximuzes the meaning and satisfaction you'll associate with your working life . . . In short, I'll live the focused life, because it's the best kind there is.

### A Psychological Argument for Depth

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

> This, ultimately, is the lesson to come away with from our brief foray into the world of experimental psychology: To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.

### A Philosophical Argument for Depth

### Homo Sapiens Deepensis

# Part 2 - The Rules
## Rule 1 - Work Deeply

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add _routines_ and _rituals_ to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life. You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, a mismatch can derail your deep work habit before it solidifies. 

#### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of this philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing. 

The pool to whom this applies is limited. 

Is your contribution to the world discrete, clear, and individualized?

#### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically--seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. The division of time can happen on multiple scales. For example, in a week, you might dedicate four day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain muost of your deep stretches (like a sabbatical).

The minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at l east one full day. A few hours in the morning is too short to count as deep work for an adherent.

#### The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

The "Chain Method" (aka seinfeld method) is an example of the rhythmic philosophy.

Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work. This reduces the barrier to entry for going deep, eliminating scheduling decisions, etc.

> He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by 5:30 every morning. He would then work until 7:30, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his obligations for the day.

"Astronomically productive and guilt free."

By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.

#### The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

How Isaacson works:

> It was always amazing ... he could retreat up to the bedroom for a while, when the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to work on his book .... he'd go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we'd hear the typewriter pounding, then he'd come down as. Relaxed as the rest of us... the work never seemed to faze him, he just happily went up to work when he had the spare time.

> I instead tend to map out when i'll work deeply during each week at the beginning of the week, and then refine those decisions, as needed, at the beginning of each day.. By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself.

### Ritualize

### Make Grand Gestures

### Don't Work Alone

### Execute Like a Business

The division between what and how is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world.

#### Disclipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important

#### Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures

#### Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

#### Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability

### Be Lazy

#### 1. Downtime Aids Insights.

#### 2. Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply

#### 3. The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important 

## Rule 2 - Embrace Boredom

> You cannot consider yourself as fulfilling this daily obligation unless youh ave stretched to the reaches of your mental capacity

Rabbi, on the early morning study of written judaism amongst orthodox jews.

"This consistent strain has built my mental muscle over years and years. This was not the goal when I started, but it is the effect."

The ability to intensely concentrate is a skill that must be trained. It's not a habit like flossing. 

Corollary - efforts to deepen your focus will strugge if you don't wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.

> So we have scales that allow us to divide up people into people who multitask all the time and people who rarely do, and the differences are remarkable. People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted. They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand ... they're pretty much mental wrecks.

Two Goals:
1. Improve your ability to concentrate intensely; and
2. Overcoming your desire for distraction

### Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.

Q: What does he mean by "Network Connection"?
A: Network Tools: defined as any communication protocol like SMS and email, social media like FB/Twitter, and infotainment sites like Reddit.

Strategy: schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and thenh avoid it altogether outside these times. The idea is that its not the use of a distracting service by itself that reduces your ability to focus, instead its the constant switching from low stimuli / high value and high stimuli / low value activities, at the slight hint of boredom, that teaches your mind not to tolerate the absence of novelty.

This flips the script, and a full day of scheduled distraction becomes a full day of mental calisthenics.


#### Point 1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.

#### Point 2: Regardless of how you schedule your internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.

#### Point 3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training. 

### Work Like Teddy Roosevelt

Practice intense focus by setting an aggressive timeline and throwing yourself 100% at the task; start with once a week as its mentally very demanding. Once you'e confident in your ability to trade concentration for completion time, increase the frequency of these dashes. Always keep the self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility. These dashes should be incompatible with distraction, since you won't make it if you're distracted. They also make you resist losing focus. This should transform your understanding o hat it means to focus when you reach stronger intensity levels. 

### Meditate Productively

The goal is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally - walking, jogging, driving, showering - and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem.

This could be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on something, or sharpening a business strategy. Like with mindfulness meditation, you should continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.

That said, it improves your ability to think deeply. You will be practicing resisting distraction as well as returning your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem. 

#### Suggestion 1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping

First act of mental rebellion is going to unrelated but seemingly more interesting thoughts. Looping is when  you are faced with a hard problem and your mind attempts to aoid excess expenditure of energyg by sidestepping it and avoiding diving deeper into teh problem, by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it. When you see yoruself in a loop, redirect your attention toward the next step.

#### Suggestion 2: Structure Your Deep Thinking

Thinking deeply about a problem is actually not that intuitive. The process he uses are starting witha.  Review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing them in your working memory. If you're working on a book chapter, variables would be the points to be made in that chapter. 

Once you have identified the variable, then you need to define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables. "How am I going to efectively open this chapter?" 

Now that you have the variables stored, and a next step question posed, you have a target for your attention. If/when you can solve your next-step question, the final step to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified . Then, you you can push yourself to the next level of depth by satrting the process over. This cyccle of reviewing, storing, identifying and tacking quetions, and finally consolidating your gains is like an intense workout routine for your concentration ability.

### Memorize a Deck of Cards

## Rule 3 - Quit Social Media

### Apply the Rule of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits

> In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.

### Quit Social Media

### Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

The sixteen hours a day you're not at work should be a day within a day; during those sixteen hours you should use your time like an aristocrat: performing rigorous self-improvement which requires reading great literature and poetry according to this 1900s english author.

The real point is that you should adn can make deliberate use of your time outside work in a productive way -- and to do that, you need to reduce the impact of network tools on your ability to perform deep work.

To get away from Reddit, put more thought in to your leisure time. Don't default to whatever catches your attention at the moment; instead dedicate advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your day within a day.

Dedication to a thoughtful selection of books, exercise, or just good company are all better than Reddit.

Personal Point: spend quality time with Maggie, continue reading habit, and exercise better than vegging.

Q: will structuring leisure time lead to more exhaustion, and less refreshing at work the next day?

> What? You say that full energy given to those siteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will increase the value of the business eight. One of teh chief things which typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change -- not rest, except in sleep.

## Rule 4 - Drain the Shallows

### Schedule Every Minute of your Day

### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

> How long would it take, in months, to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

### Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

### Finish Your Work by Five Thirty
 
> Fixed-Schedule Productivity - Fisk the firm gol of not working past a certaint time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration. 

> by his estimation, he spent only one and a half out of the twelve total hours sitting in his office tacking "real" work, which he defines as efforts that make progress toward a "research deliverable."

> according to her article, one of the main techniques for respecting her hour limit (50 hours) was to set drastic quotas on the major sources of shallow endeavors in her academic life.

Ruthlessly cap shallow pursuits and maximize deep work at all times to fit in to the work allocation that you've given for yourself.

It should take you awhile to agree to anything that will burden you with shallow work.

Turn down firmly, but be vague about the reasons, and avoid agreeing to timesuck concessions: "I can't make it, but I can review any proposals you get in", etc.

The cap of a fixed productivity schedule really keeps you on point in making sure you are maximally productive, not wasting time, and working towards long term goals.

The reduction in shallow time frees up more energy for deep work, and yo ucan produce more than with a crowded funeral. The time limitation also forces you to think more thoughtfully about organizational habits, leading to more value produced compared to less organized schedules.

Commitment to fixed-schedule productivity puts you in a scarcity mindset. 

Your default answer should be no.

# Conclusion

# Questions

1. What does he mean by deep work?
2. Is deep work even applicable to the type of work that I do? Running a business? Or is this mainly for knowledge workers?
3. What are the action items? What can actually be put into practice? Off the top of your head, what to move forward realistically?
    - The structured meditation should be tried on commute to or from work.
    - need to choose a deep work philosophy
    - need to consider the stuff about boredom, this is a real problem with me. Be fine with being bored, don't get distracted so easily
    - schedule every minute of every day -- to both be productive by capping work hours, reduce shallow work, and to have focused personal time in the off-work hours.
